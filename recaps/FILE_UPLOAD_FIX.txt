# File Upload Fix Summary

## Issue
The file upload functionality was not working when a user selected a JSON file and clicked "Generate Reports".

## Root Cause
The HTML file (templates/index.html) contained incomplete inline JavaScript that did not include the upload functionality. Meanwhile, there was a complete implementation in the static/script.js file, but it wasn't being loaded by the HTML file.

## Fix Applied
1. Removed the incomplete inline JavaScript from the HTML file
2. Added a script tag to properly load the external JavaScript file:
   ```html
   <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='script.js') }}"></script>
   ```

## How the Fix Works
- Now when the page loads, it properly includes the complete JavaScript from static/script.js
- This includes all the event handlers, particularly the one for the "Generate Reports" button that was missing
- The upload functionality is now fully operational, allowing users to:
  - Select a JSON file
  - Click "Generate Reports"
  - See the processing status
  - Download the resulting reports

## Deployment
For the changes to take effect on your Heroku application, you need to redeploy by pushing the changes to your Heroku Git repository:

```bash
git add templates/index.html
git commit -m "Fix file upload functionality by loading external JavaScript"
git push heroku main
```

This will trigger a new build and deployment of your application.
