# Bearing Column Removal Changes

## Overview
I've modified the code to remove the bearing column from the Excel output while keeping it in the DataFrame for internal processing. This change won't affect the functionality of your code.

## Changes Made
1. Updated the comment in `create_output_excel` function to indicate that "Connection ID, SCID, and Bearing are excluded from Excel output"
2. Removed "Bearing" from the `desired_columns` list which determines what columns are included in the final Excel file

## Impact
- The bearing information is still preserved in the DataFrame and used for internal processing
- Bearing direction is still visible in your Excel through the descriptive labels for reference spans and backspans (e.g., "REF (N)" or "Backspan (SE)") in the "Attacher Description" column
- Bearing information is still used in remedy descriptions for underground connections
- All functionality remains intact as the bearing data is still being calculated and stored internally

## Result
The Excel output will no longer include the bearing column, while preserving all the necessary functionality of your code.
