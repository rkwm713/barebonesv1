# MakeReady Report Generator Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. File Upload Not Working

**Problem:** When selecting a JSON file and clicking "Generate Reports", nothing happened.

**Root Cause:** The HTML file (templates/index.html) contained incomplete inline JavaScript that didn't include the upload functionality. Meanwhile, there was a complete implementation in static/script.js, but it wasn't being loaded by the HTML.

**Solution:**
- Removed the incomplete inline JavaScript from the HTML file
- Added a script tag to properly load the external JavaScript file:
  ```html
  <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='script.js') }}"></script>
  ```

### 2. Status Check Errors After Upload

**Problem:** After uploading a file, the browser console showed 404 errors when checking the processing status:
```
/status/e8c675b7-2b75-4ccc-ae15-31a988272bcb:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (NOT FOUND)
Error checking status: Error: Status check failed
```

**Root Cause:** The `processing_tasks` dictionary is stored in-memory. On Heroku, the application may be restarted or requests might be routed to different dynos, causing the task IDs to be lost.

**Solution:**

1. **Client-side Improvements:**
   - Added error counting for status check failures
   - After 3 failed attempts, shows a user-friendly error message instead of silently failing
   - Error message explains that the server may have restarted and suggests trying again

   ```javascript
   .catch(error => {
       console.error('Error checking status:', error);
       // After several failed attempts, show an error
       if (!window.statusCheckErrors) {
           window.statusCheckErrors = 0;
       }
       window.statusCheckErrors++;
       
       // After 3 failed attempts, show error and stop checking
       if (window.statusCheckErrors >= 3) {
           clearInterval(statusCheckInterval);
           showErrorCard('The server lost track of your upload. This can happen if the server was restarted. Please try uploading again.');
       }
   });
   ```

2. **Server-side Improvements:**
   - Added additional logging when processing files
   - Added a safety check to verify the task still exists in the processing_tasks dictionary
   - Added logging to help diagnose when tasks go missing

## Additional Considerations for Future Development

For a more robust solution in a production environment, consider:

1. **Persistent Storage:** Replace the in-memory task tracking with a database (PostgreSQL on Heroku) or Redis to persist task state across application restarts.

2. **File Storage:** Use AWS S3 or Heroku's add-ons for file storage instead of in-memory storage, which is lost when dynos restart.

3. **Background Worker:** Consider using a proper background job system like Celery with RabbitMQ/Redis to handle processing tasks, which would be more reliable for long-running operations.

## Deployment Instructions

For the changes to take effect on your Heroku application, you need to redeploy by pushing the changes to your Heroku Git repository:

```bash
git add templates/index.html static/script.js app.py
git commit -m "Fix file upload functionality and improve error handling"
git push heroku main
```

This will trigger a new build and deployment of your application.
