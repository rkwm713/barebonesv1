EQUIPMENT TYPE FALLBACK UPDATE
==============================

Date: 5/22/2025

SUMMARY:
--------
Modified the code to implement a fallback mechanism for equipment_type when it's missing in trace_data. 
The code will now check the photofirst item's own equipment_type field when the trace_data doesn't provide this information.

CHANGES MADE:
------------
1. Located the equipment category handling section in the get_attachers_for_node method
2. Added fallback logic to check item_value.get("equipment_type") when trace_info.get("equipment_type") is empty
3. Added debug logging to track when the fallback is used

CODE CHANGES:
------------
Added the following code to the equipment category processing section:

```python
elif category == "equipment":
    item_type_str = trace_info.get("equipment_type", "").strip()
    if not item_type_str:
        # fallback to the item's own field
        item_type_str = item_value.get("equipment_type", "").strip()
        print(f"DEBUG: Fallback to photofirst equipment_type for item in node {node_id}: {item_type_str}")
```

BENEFITS:
--------
1. Improved data capture for equipment items
2. Reduced skipped items due to missing equipment_type values
3. Better representation of field equipment in the output reports
4. Added debug logging for easier troubleshooting

This update ensures more complete equipment data processing by using all available information from both trace_data and photofirst data.
