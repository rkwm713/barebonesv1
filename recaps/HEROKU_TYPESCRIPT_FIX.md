# Heroku TypeScript Build Fix

## Problem
The Heroku deployment was failing with the following error during the TypeScript compilation phase:

```
src/api/client.ts(3,34): error TS2339: Property 'env' does not exist on type 'ImportMeta'.
```

This error occurred in `frontend/src/api/client.ts` where the code used `import.meta.env.DEV` to determine the API base URL. TypeScript was not aware of the Vite-specific `import.meta.env` types, causing the compilation to fail.

## Solution
Added a TypeScript declaration file for Vite environment variables:

1. Created `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` with declarations for:
   - `ImportMetaEnv` interface defining Vite's environment variables
   - `ImportMeta` interface with an `env` property referencing `ImportMetaEnv`

This solution provides the TypeScript compiler with the necessary type information about Vite's environment variables and the `import.meta.env` object structure.

## Expected Result
The TypeScript compiler should now recognize `import.meta.env.DEV` as a valid property and allow the build to complete successfully on Heroku.

## Testing
The fix should be verified by:
1. Deploying to Heroku and confirming the build succeeds
2. Verifying the frontend application loads correctly

## Additional Notes
- This is a common issue when using Vite with TypeScript, as the type definitions for Vite's environment variables need to be explicitly declared
- The file name `vite-env.d.ts` follows Vite's convention for TypeScript declaration files
- No changes to existing code were required, only the addition of type declarations
