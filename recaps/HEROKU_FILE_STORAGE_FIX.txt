# HEROKU FILE STORAGE FIX

## Issue
On Heroku, the application was encountering an error related to file storage paths:

```
OSError: Cannot save file into a non-existent directory: '/app/Downloads'
```

This error occurred because the application was trying to write files to the `/app/Downloads` directory, which doesn't exist on Heroku's read-only filesystem.

## Root Cause
1. Heroku's filesystem is **read-only** with the exception of the `/tmp` directory
2. The code was using `os.path.expanduser("~")` plus "Downloads" to find where to store files
3. On a local development machine, this would be something like `/home/user/Downloads`
4. On Heroku, this resolves to `/app/Downloads`, which doesn't exist and cannot be created

The key insight is that in Heroku's containerized environment:
- The application runs in a read-only "slug"
- Only the `/tmp` directory is writable
- The `/app` directory is the root of the application but is immutable at runtime

## Solution
Modified the file processing logic to:

1. Use the `/tmp` directory for file storage, which is writable on Heroku
2. Store file data directly in memory using `io.BytesIO` buffers 
3. Stream files back to the client without relying on persistent disk storage
4. Create fallbacks to generate files directly in memory if they don't exist on disk

Key code changes:
```python
# Use the temp directory for file storage (Heroku-compatible)
tmp_dir = "/tmp"
os.makedirs(tmp_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Process and store files in memory directly
excel_data = io.BytesIO()
# ... generate Excel file in memory ...

# Also save a copy to tmp for debugging if needed
excel_path = os.path.join(tmp_dir, f"{base_filename}_{task_id}.xlsx")
with open(excel_path, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(excel_data.getvalue())
```

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Works on Heroku**: Uses the writable `/tmp` directory
2. **Memory-First Design**: Prioritizes in-memory processing for faster response times
3. **Disk Fallback**: Still checks for files on disk as a fallback mechanism
4. **Direct Streaming**: Uses FastAPI's `StreamingResponse` to send files directly to the client
5. **Reliability**: Doesn't depend on files persisting on disk, which is important since Heroku's `/tmp` is ephemeral

## Additional Benefits
The solution improves several aspects of the application:
1. **Resilience**: The application will work even if the processor doesn't write files to disk
2. **Performance**: In-memory processing is faster than disk I/O
3. **Portability**: The application will work in any environment, regardless of file system permissions

## Testing
The solution has been tested to ensure:
1. Files can be generated and stored in memory
2. The `/tmp` directory is used for any necessary disk operations
3. Files can be streamed back to the client without errors

## Future Considerations
For a more robust solution in a production environment:
1. **Cloud Storage**: Consider using AWS S3 or similar cloud storage for permanent file storage
2. **Database Storage**: For smaller files, consider storing them in a database
3. **Redis Cache**: For temporary file storage, Redis could be used instead of in-memory dictionaries

## Implementation Notes
1. Added pandas import for direct Excel file generation
2. Created memory buffers for both Excel and log files
3. Added fallback mechanisms to generate files if they don't exist
4. Used `/tmp` directory for all file operations that require disk access
