Summary of Changes for Midspan Proposed Height Logic (barebones.py) - 2025-05-23

This update modifies the logic for populating the "Mid-Span (same span as existing)" column in the Excel output.

Key Change in `FileProcessor.create_output_excel`:

1.  **Conditional Midspan Population for Main Attachers:**
    *   When processing main pole attachers (`Main_Attacher` category):
        *   The "Mid-Span (same span as existing)" column is now populated **only if** the pole attacher itself has a proposed height (`attacher.get('proposed_height')` is non-empty).
        *   A non-empty `proposed_height` for a pole attacher indicates that it is either a new attacher or an existing one that has moved.
        *   If the condition is met (attacher is new or moved), `self.get_midspan_proposed_heights()` is called to calculate and populate the midspan value.
        *   If the condition is not met (attacher's height at the pole has not changed), the "Mid-Span (same span as existing)" column will be an empty string for that attacher.

This change ensures that proposed midspan heights are only shown when the corresponding pole attachment has also changed, aligning with the user's feedback.
