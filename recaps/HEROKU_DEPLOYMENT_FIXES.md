# Heroku Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve deployment issues with the Heroku application.

## Fix 1: TypeScript Build Error

### Problem
The Heroku deployment was failing with the following error during the TypeScript compilation phase:

```
src/api/client.ts(3,34): error TS2339: Property 'env' does not exist on type 'ImportMeta'.
```

This error occurred in `frontend/src/api/client.ts` where the code used `import.meta.env.DEV` to determine the API base URL. TypeScript was not aware of the Vite-specific `import.meta.env` types, causing the compilation to fail.

### Solution
Added a TypeScript declaration file for Vite environment variables:

1. Created `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` with declarations for:
   - `ImportMetaEnv` interface defining Vite's environment variables
   - `ImportMeta` interface with an `env` property referencing `ImportMetaEnv`

This solution provides the TypeScript compiler with the necessary type information about Vite's environment variables and the `import.meta.env` object structure.

## Fix 2: API Endpoint Duplication

### Problem
After the application was deployed, it was encountering API errors with routes like:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
/api/api/upload
```

The issue was in the `frontend/src/api/client.ts` file where API endpoints were being prefixed twice with `/api`:
1. First, `API_BASE_URL` was set to `/api` in production mode
2. Then, each API endpoint function explicitly added `/api` again to the route path

This resulted in duplicated paths like `/api/api/upload` instead of just `/api/upload`.

### Solution
Modified the API endpoint functions in `frontend/src/api/client.ts` to remove the duplicated `/api` prefix:

1. Updated `uploadFile()` to use `/upload` instead of `/api/upload`
2. Updated `getTaskStatus()` to use `/tasks/${taskId}/status` instead of `/api/tasks/${taskId}/status` 
3. Updated `downloadFile()` to use `${API_BASE_URL}/tasks/${taskId}/download/${fileType}` instead of hardcoding the `/api` prefix
4. Updated `cleanupTask()` to use `/tasks/${taskId}` instead of `/api/tasks/${taskId}`

With these changes, the application now correctly forms API URLs:
- In development: `/upload`, `/tasks/...`, etc.
- In production: `/api/upload`, `/api/tasks/...`, etc.

## Testing
The fixes should be verified by:
1. Deploying to Heroku and confirming the build succeeds
2. Verifying the frontend application loads correctly
3. Testing file upload functionality to ensure API endpoints are correctly resolved
4. Checking task status retrieval to ensure API communication works properly

## Logging
Both issues were fixed with minimal code changes:
1. Addition of type declarations without modifying existing code
2. Correction of API endpoint paths to avoid duplication

These changes ensure the application deploys successfully and functions correctly in both development and production environments.
