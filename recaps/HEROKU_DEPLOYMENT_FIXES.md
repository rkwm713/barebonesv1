# Heroku Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve deployment issues with the Heroku application.

## Fix 1: TypeScript Build Error

### Problem
The Heroku deployment was failing with the following error during the TypeScript compilation phase:

```
src/api/client.ts(3,34): error TS2339: Property 'env' does not exist on type 'ImportMeta'.
```

This error occurred in `frontend/src/api/client.ts` where the code used `import.meta.env.DEV` to determine the API base URL. TypeScript was not aware of the Vite-specific `import.meta.env` types, causing the compilation to fail.

### Solution
Added a TypeScript declaration file for Vite environment variables:

1. Created `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` with declarations for:
   - `ImportMetaEnv` interface defining Vite's environment variables
   - `ImportMeta` interface with an `env` property referencing `ImportMetaEnv`

This solution provides the TypeScript compiler with the necessary type information about Vite's environment variables and the `import.meta.env` object structure.

## Fix 2: API Endpoint Mismatch

### Problem
After fixing the TypeScript build error, the application was still encountering API errors during deployment with:

```
INFO: 50.24.172.246:0 - "POST /api/api/upload HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed
```

We identified two conflicting issues:

1. In the **frontend** (`src/api/client.ts`), API paths were being configured with:
   - `API_BASE_URL` set to `/api` in production mode
   - Each API endpoint function adding another `/api` prefix (e.g., `/api/upload`)
   - This created duplicated paths like `/api/api/upload`

2. In the **backend** (`backend/app.py`), routes were defined with the `/api` prefix:
   - `@app.post("/api/upload", response_model=UploadResponse)`
   - `@app.get("/api/tasks/{task_id}/status", response_model=TaskStatus)`
   - etc.

### Solution
We applied a two-part fix:

1. First, we modified the **frontend** API functions in `src/api/client.ts` to remove their `/api` prefix:
   - Updated `uploadFile()` to use `/upload` instead of `/api/upload`
   - Updated `getTaskStatus()` to use `/tasks/${taskId}/status` instead of `/api/tasks/${taskId}/status` 
   - Updated `downloadFile()` to use `${API_BASE_URL}/tasks/${taskId}/download/${fileType}` instead of hardcoding the `/api` prefix
   - Updated `cleanupTask()` to use `/tasks/${taskId}` instead of `/api/tasks/${taskId}`

2. Then, we updated the **backend** routes in `backend/app.py` to remove the `/api` prefix:
   - Changed `@app.post("/api/upload")` to `@app.post("/upload")`
   - Changed `@app.get("/api/tasks/{task_id}/status")` to `@app.get("/tasks/{task_id}/status")`
   - And similarly for the download and delete endpoints

With these coordinated changes, the application now correctly forms API URLs:
- In development: `/upload`, `/tasks/...`, etc.
- In production: `/api/upload`, `/api/tasks/...`, etc. (with `/api` added by the `API_BASE_URL` setting only)

### WebSocket Configuration
The WebSocket endpoint was already correctly configured:
- Frontend constructs WebSocket URL as: `${protocol}//${window.location.host}/ws/tasks/${taskId}`
- Backend defines WebSocket route as: `@app.websocket("/ws/tasks/{task_id}")`

This consistency meant no changes were needed for the WebSocket functionality.

## Testing
The fixes should be verified by:
1. Deploying to Heroku and confirming the build succeeds
2. Verifying the frontend application loads correctly without console errors
3. Testing file upload functionality to ensure API endpoints are correctly resolved
4. Checking task status retrieval to ensure API communication works properly
5. Verifying WebSocket connection for real-time updates

## Logging
All issues were fixed with minimal, targeted code changes:
1. Addition of TypeScript type declarations to support Vite's environment variables
2. Correction of frontend API endpoint paths to remove the duplicated `/api` prefix
3. Matching changes to backend API routes to ensure consistent endpoint paths

These changes ensure the application deploys successfully and functions correctly in both development and production environments.
