=== HEROKU DOWNLOADS PATH FIX ===
Date: May 23, 2025
Issue: OSError: Cannot save file into a non-existent directory: '/app/Downloads'

PROBLEM:
The application was trying to save files to ~/Downloads which translates to /app/Downloads on Heroku.
Heroku's filesystem is read-only except for the /tmp directory.

SOLUTION:
Updated FileProcessor class to detect when running on Heroku (via DYNO environment variable) 
and use /tmp directory instead of ~/Downloads.

FILES MODIFIED:
1. backend/barebones.py
2. barebones.py  
3. app.py

CHANGES MADE:
In FileProcessor.__init__() method:
```python
def __init__(self):
    # Use /tmp directory on Heroku, otherwise use Downloads folder
    if os.environ.get('DYNO'):  # Heroku sets DYNO environment variable
        self.downloads_path = "/tmp"
    else:
        self.downloads_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "Downloads")
    self.job_data = None
    self.logger = ProcessingLogger()
```

In app.py process_file() function:
```python
# Use /tmp directory on Heroku, otherwise use Downloads folder
if os.environ.get('DYNO'):  # Heroku sets DYNO environment variable
    downloads_path = "/tmp"
else:
    downloads_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "Downloads")
```

NOTE: backend/app.py was already using /tmp directory and didn't need modification.

TESTING:
The fix should now allow the application to run successfully on Heroku by using the writable /tmp directory
instead of trying to create files in the non-existent /app/Downloads directory.

DEPLOYMENT:
After applying these changes, commit and push to Heroku:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix file storage path for Heroku deployment"
git push heroku main
