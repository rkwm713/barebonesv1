## Reference Span Height Source Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-05-23

**Issue:**
The previous implementation of the reference height fix had several issues:
1.  Missing variable definition (`main_pole_attachers_lookup`) in `get_reference_attachers`.
2.  Missing `get_main_pole_attacher_heights()` helper method.
3.  Inconsistent logic placement for creating the lookup dictionary.

**Fixes Implemented in `barebones.py`:**
1.  **Added `get_main_pole_attacher_heights(self, job_data, node_id)` helper method:** This new method is responsible for generating a dictionary lookup of attacher heights (existing and proposed) specifically from the *main pole's* data.
2.  **Modified `get_reference_attachers(self, job_data, current_node_id)`:**
    *   Added a call to `self.get_main_pole_attacher_heights(job_data, current_node_id)` at the beginning of the method to create the `main_pole_attachers_lookup` dictionary within the correct scope.
    *   Ensured that when processing attachers found on the reference span's midpoint photo, the actual existing and proposed heights written to the `span_attachers` list are retrieved from the `main_pole_attachers_lookup` using the attacher's description as the key. This correctly sources the heights from the main pole where the work is happening, rather than the reference span's midpoint.
3.  **Removed duplicate logic:** The incorrect logic that attempted to create the lookup within the `create_output_excel` method (specifically within the 'refs' sheet generation loop) was removed. The `create_output_excel` method now calls `get_main_pole_attacher_heights` directly when populating columns N and O of the 'refs' sheet, ensuring the correct data source is used there as well.

**Result:**
The `get_reference_attachers` method now correctly identifies attachers present on reference spans but retrieves their associated heights from the main pole's data. This resolves the `NameError` and ensures that the Excel output (both the main sheet and the 'refs' sheet) accurately reflects the main pole's attacher heights for reference spans.
