## Current Objective: Finalize and Test "Refs" Sheet Data Fixes

**Status:** Fixes for "refs" sheet data population in `barebones.py` have been implemented.

**Context:**
The primary issue was that the "refs" sheet (the second sheet in the output Excel) was not being populated correctly, particularly for poles that are sources of reference spans and for the special handling of "002.A" poles. Additionally, the data mapping for columns N, O, P, and Q for `Ref_Span_Attacher` rows needed adjustment.

**Implemented Fixes in `barebones.py` (within `create_output_excel` method):**
1.  **Stale `attacher_data` Resolved:** Ensured `attacher_data` (and subsequently `main_pole_attachers_lookup`) is fetched *inside* the loop iterating through main poles for the "refs" sheet. This provides the correct context for each pole's main attacher heights when looking up data for its reference spans.
2.  **Refined "002.A" Fallback Logic:**
    *   Introduced a new boolean flag `data_actually_written_for_pole_refs` initialized to `False` for each main pole.
    *   This flag is set to `True` if any `Ref_Span_Attacher` data is written for the current main pole.
    *   The placeholder row for "002.A" poles is now only written if `data_actually_written_for_pole_refs` remains `False` (i.e., no actual reference span data from that pole was outputted).
3.  **Corrected Column Data for `Ref_Span_Attacher` Rows:**
    *   Column N (index 4): `main_pole_existing_h` (Main Pole Existing Height)
    *   Column O (index 5): `main_pole_proposed_h` (Main Pole Proposed Height)
    *   Column P (index 6): `mid_span_proposed_h` (Mid-Span Proposed Height - note header is "Mid-Span Existing Height")
    *   Column Q (index 7): `mid_span_existing_h` (Mid-Span Existing Height - note header is "Mid-Span Proposed Height")

**Next Steps:**
1.  Update `projectRoadmap.md` to mark the "refs" sheet fix task as complete.
2.  Update `codebaseSummary.md` to reflect the changes made to `barebones.py` concerning "refs" sheet generation.
3.  Create a summary text file (`cline_docs/ref_sheet_data_fix_summary.txt`) detailing the applied fixes.
4.  Inform the user of the completed changes and suggest testing the script with `test_job_data.json` to verify the "refs" sheet output.
