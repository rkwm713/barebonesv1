# Current Task

## Objective
Resolve issues causing Excel file corruption when downloading reports generated by the application. Implement robust file handling, path management, and error checking.

## Current Focus
- Initial fixes for file path consistency, unique naming, and robust Excel writer handling have been applied to `barebones.py`, `app.py`, and `backend/app.py`.
- `Content-Length` headers added to download responses.

## Next Steps
1.  **Verify Changes**: Test the application locally (if possible) or guide the user through testing to confirm that the recent changes have improved Excel download reliability.
2.  **Address Remaining `projectRoadmap.md` Tasks**:
    *   Further enhance error handling within `create_output_excel` for cell merging and formatting.
    *   Implement comprehensive logging for file operations (creation, access, deletion).
    *   Consider adding checksum validation for downloaded files if corruption persists.
3.  **Update Documentation**: Ensure `techStack.md` and `codebaseSummary.md` are created and reflect the current state and architecture.
