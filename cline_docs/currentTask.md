# Current Task

## Objective
Ensure accurate and reliable Excel report generation, including correct identification/representation of reference spans and conditional population of midspan proposed heights, alongside ongoing efforts to improve overall application stability and error handling.

## Current Focus
- **Completed**: Implemented new logic in `barebones.py` for identifying and processing reference spans as per the "playbook".
- **Completed**: Updated `create_output_excel` in `barebones.py` to conditionally populate the "Mid-Span (same span as existing)" column for main pole attachers.
- **Completed**: Created `userInstructions/local_testing_setup.md` with detailed steps for setting up and running the application locally for testing.
- Previous fixes for `format_height_feet_inches`, Heroku file location, path consistency, unique naming, robust Excel writer handling, and `Content-Length` headers are in place.

## Next Steps
1.  **Local Testing**:
    *   User to follow instructions in `userInstructions/local_testing_setup.md` to set up a local testing environment.
    *   Thoroughly test the `barebones.py` script (and optionally the full application stack) with various JSON inputs to ensure:
        *   Reference spans are correctly identified and formatted.
        *   The "Mid-Span (same span as existing)" column is correctly populated.
    *   If local testing is successful, guide the user through testing on Heroku (if applicable).
2.  **Update Documentation**:
    *   Update `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` to add a task for local testing setup documentation and mark it as complete.
    *   Update `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md` to mention the availability of local testing instructions.
3.  **Address Remaining `projectRoadmap.md` Tasks**:
    *   Further enhance error handling within `create_output_excel` for cell merging and formatting.
    *   Implement comprehensive logging for file operations (creation, access, deletion).
    *   Consider adding checksum validation for downloaded files if corruption persists (though recent fixes might have mitigated this).
