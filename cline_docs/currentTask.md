# Current Task

## Objective
Ensure accurate and reliable Excel report generation, particularly concerning the correct identification and representation of reference spans, alongside ongoing efforts to improve overall application stability and error handling.

## Current Focus
- **Completed**: Implemented new logic in `barebones.py` for identifying and processing reference spans as per the "playbook". This includes:
    - New helper functions `get_scid_from_node_data` and `is_reference_connection`.
    - Overhauled `get_reference_attachers` method to use the new checks, correctly build "Ref (...)" blocks with accurate bearing, node type, and filtered/sorted attachers.
    - Updated `create_output_excel` to use the new reference span header text.
- Previous fixes for `format_height_feet_inches`, Heroku file location, path consistency, unique naming, robust Excel writer handling, and `Content-Length` headers are in place.

## Next Steps
1.  **Testing and Verification**:
    *   Thoroughly test the `barebones.py` script with various JSON inputs to ensure:
        *   Reference spans are correctly identified (and false positives suppressed, e.g., PL410620).
        *   "Ref (...)" blocks are structured and formatted as specified in the playbook (header, attacher details, sorting).
        *   Multiple reference spans are handled correctly and ordered by bearing.
    *   If local testing is successful, guide the user through testing on Heroku (if applicable).
2.  **Update Documentation**:
    *   Update `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` to mark the reference span task as complete and add any new sub-tasks if identified during testing.
    *   Update `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md` to reflect the changes in `barebones.py` related to reference span processing and the new helper functions.
3.  **Address Remaining `projectRoadmap.md` Tasks**:
    *   Further enhance error handling within `create_output_excel` for cell merging and formatting.
    *   Implement comprehensive logging for file operations (creation, access, deletion).
    *   Consider adding checksum validation for downloaded files if corruption persists (though recent fixes might have mitigated this).
