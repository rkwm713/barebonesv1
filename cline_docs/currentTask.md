# Current Task

## Objective
Resolve issues causing Excel file corruption when downloading reports generated by the application. Implement robust file handling, path management, and error checking.

## Current Focus
- Implemented a more robust correction in `format_height_feet_inches` function in `barebones.py` to definitively prevent incorrect height strings like "24' 12"". This includes ensuring integer conversion and an explicit check to roll over inches >= 12 to feet.
- Addressed file location logic in `backend/app.py` to correctly find timestamped and UUID-prefixed files generated by `FileProcessor` on Heroku.
- Previous fixes for file path consistency, unique naming, robust Excel writer handling, and `Content-Length` headers are in place.

## Next Steps
1.  **Verify Changes on Heroku**: Guide the user through testing the application on Heroku to confirm that:
    - Results are now displayed.
    - Files can be downloaded without corruption.
    - Height formatting is correct (e.g., no "X' 12"" values).
2.  **Address Remaining `projectRoadmap.md` Tasks**:
    *   Further enhance error handling within `create_output_excel` for cell merging and formatting.
    *   Implement comprehensive logging for file operations (creation, access, deletion).
    *   Consider adding checksum validation for downloaded files if corruption persists.
3.  **Update Documentation**: Ensure `techStack.md` and `codebaseSummary.md` are created and reflect the current state and architecture.
