Updated functionality in `barebones.py` for the "refs" sheet in the output Excel file.

**Initial Changes:**
- Created a new sheet named "refs".
- Included poles that have:
    1. A reference connection.
    2. An SCID containing "002.A".
- Initial columns: "Pole #", "SCID", "Reference SCID".

**Second Update (Refined "refs" sheet):**
- Modified `FileProcessor.get_reference_attachers` method to include the actual SCID of the reference structure (`ref_scid`) and the reference node type (`ref_node_type`) in its output for each reference span.
- Modified `FileProcessor.create_output_excel` method to enhance the "refs" sheet:
    - Updated headers to: "Pole #", "SCID" (main pole), "Ref. Structure SCID", "Attacher Name", "Existing Mid-Span Height", "Proposed Mid-Span Height".
    - For each pole that is a source of a reference connection:
        - Iterates through each reference span originating from the main pole.
        - For each attacher on that reference span (these are mid-span measurements):
            - Writes a new row to the "refs" sheet containing:
                - Main Pole #: The pole number of the source pole.
                - SCID: The SCID of the source pole.
                - Ref. Structure SCID: The actual SCID of the connected reference structure.
                - Attacher Name: The name of the attacher on the reference span.
                - Existing Mid-Span Height: The existing height of the attacher at the mid-point of the reference span.
                - Proposed Mid-Span Height: The proposed height of the attacher at the mid-point of the reference span.
    - For poles with an SCID containing "002.A":
        - If the pole was not already listed as a source of any reference spans, a single row is added for it.
        - This row includes the "Pole #", "SCID", with "Ref. Structure SCID" marked as "N/A - Pole is 002.A" and "Attacher Name" as "Pole SCID is 002.A". Height columns are left blank for these entries.
    - Added auto-fitting for the new column layout in the "refs" sheet.
