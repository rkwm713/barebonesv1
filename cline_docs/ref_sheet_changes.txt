Added functionality to `barebones.py` to create a new sheet named "refs" in the output Excel file.

The "refs" sheet includes poles that have:
1. A reference connection (drawn with the "ref" tool and targeting a node with a "." in its SCID).
2. An SCID containing "002.A".

The sheet contains the following columns:
- Pole #
- SCID
- Reference SCID (or "002.A SCID" as applicable)

The `create_output_excel` method in the `FileProcessor` class was modified to:
- Create the "refs" worksheet.
- Add headers to the "refs" sheet.
- Iterate through the processed pole data (from the `df` DataFrame).
- Check each pole for reference connections using the `is_reference_connection` helper function.
- Check each pole's SCID for the "002.A" substring.
- Write the relevant pole number, SCID, and reference SCID to the "refs" sheet.
- Implemented a basic check to avoid duplicate entries for poles that might be added due to both a reference connection and a "002.A" SCID.
- Added auto-fitting for the columns in the "refs" sheet.
