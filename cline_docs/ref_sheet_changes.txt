Updated functionality in `barebones.py` for the "refs" sheet in the output Excel file.

**Initial Changes:**
- Created a new sheet named "refs".
- Included poles that have:
    1. A reference connection.
    2. An SCID containing "002.A".
- Initial columns: "Pole #", "SCID", "Reference SCID".

**Second Update (Refined "refs" sheet - Attacher Details):**
- Modified `FileProcessor.get_reference_attachers` method to include the actual SCID of the reference structure (`ref_scid`) and the reference node type (`ref_node_type`) in its output for each reference span.
- Modified `FileProcessor.create_output_excel` method to enhance the "refs" sheet:
    - Updated headers to: "Pole #", "SCID" (main pole), "Ref. Structure SCID", "Attacher Name", "Existing Mid-Span Height", "Proposed Mid-Span Height".
    - For each pole that is a source of a reference connection:
        - Iterates through each reference span originating from the main pole.
        - For each attacher on that reference span (these are mid-span measurements):
            - Writes a new row to the "refs" sheet containing the main pole's info, the reference structure's SCID, and the attacher's mid-span details.
    - For poles with an SCID containing "002.A":
        - If the pole was not already listed as a source of any reference spans, a single row is added for it.
    - Added auto-fitting for the new column layout in the "refs" sheet.

**Third Update (Refined "refs" sheet - Main Pole Heights for Ref. Attachers):**
- Further modified `FileProcessor.create_output_excel` for the "refs" sheet:
    - Updated headers to: "Pole #", "SCID" (main pole), "Ref. Structure SCID", "Attacher Name", "Main Pole Existing Height", "Main Pole Proposed Height", "Mid-Span Existing Height", "Mid-Span Proposed Height".
    - When processing attachers on a reference span:
        - In addition to mid-span heights, the code now looks up the corresponding attacher's existing and proposed heights on the main (source) pole.
        - This is done by creating a lookup map from `attacher_data['main_attachers']` for the current source pole.
        - The "Main Pole Existing Height" and "Main Pole Proposed Height" columns are populated with these values.
    - For "002.A" SCID poles (that don't have outgoing references), the main pole height columns will be blank or "N/A".
    - Adjusted column auto-fitting for the new set of columns.

**Fourth Update (Bug Fix - "refs" sheet data population):**
- Refined the logic in `FileProcessor.create_output_excel` for populating the "refs" sheet to correctly handle "002.A" SCID poles.
- Introduced a flag `data_written_for_this_main_pole_from_its_refs` which is set to `True` if any attacher data from any of its reference spans is actually written to the sheet.
- A pole with a "002.A" SCID will now only get its specific "002.A" line if no data rows were generated from its outgoing reference spans (i.e., if all its reference spans had no listable mid-span attachers or it had no reference spans at all). This prevents 002.A poles that *do* successfully list ref span attachers from getting a redundant "Pole SCID is 002.A" line.
- Ensured that the loop for reference span attachers only attempts to write rows if `ref_span_detail.get('data')` (the list of attachers for that specific span) is not empty.
