# Heroku Deployment Fix - Frontend Build Issue

## Problem Diagnosed

Your Heroku app was showing a 404 error because the frontend build files (`frontend/dist/`) weren't being created during deployment. The FastAPI backend was running correctly, but it couldn't find the React frontend files to serve.

## Root Cause

Heroku was only using the Python buildpack and not building the frontend. The app needs both Node.js and Python buildpacks in the correct order.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created `.buildpacks` file
This tells Heroku to use both buildpacks in the correct order:
```
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python
```

### 2. Updated `package.json` 
Added a `heroku-postbuild` script that:
- Installs frontend dependencies with `npm ci`
- Builds the React app with `npm run build`
- Verifies the build was successful
- Creates the `frontend/dist/` directory that FastAPI expects

### 3. Created build verification script
Added `build-frontend.sh` as a backup option for local testing.

## Deployment Steps

### Option A: Deploy with current changes (Recommended)

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add buildpacks and frontend build process for Heroku"
   git push heroku main
   ```

2. **Monitor the build logs:**
   ```bash
   heroku logs --tail
   ```

3. **Look for these success indicators in the logs:**
   - "Installing frontend deps..."
   - "Building frontend..."
   - "Build complete. Verifying..."
   - "Frontend ready for deployment"
   - No more "Frontend build directory not found" warnings

### Option B: Clear buildpack cache (if needed)

If Option A doesn't work, clear the cache and redeploy:

1. **Clear buildpack cache:**
   ```bash
   heroku plugins:install heroku-repo
   heroku repo:purge_cache -a your-app-name
   ```

2. **Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild"
   git push heroku main
   ```

### Option C: Manual buildpack configuration (if .buildpacks doesn't work)

If the `.buildpacks` file isn't recognized:

1. **Set buildpacks manually:**
   ```bash
   heroku buildpacks:clear
   heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs
   heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python
   ```

2. **Verify buildpacks:**
   ```bash
   heroku buildpacks
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

## Expected Build Process

During deployment, you should see:

1. **Node.js buildpack runs first:**
   - Installs Node.js and npm
   - Runs `heroku-postbuild` script
   - Builds frontend to `frontend/dist/`

2. **Python buildpack runs second:**
   - Installs Python dependencies
   - Starts the FastAPI server

3. **App serves correctly:**
   - FastAPI finds `frontend/dist/` files
   - Serves React app at root URL
   - API endpoints work at `/api/*`

## Verification

After successful deployment:

1. **Check app URL:** Your app should show the React interface (not a 404)
2. **Check logs:** No more "Frontend build directory not found" warnings
3. **Test functionality:** Upload a JSON file and verify processing works

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Check build logs:**
   ```bash
   heroku logs --tail
   ```

2. **Verify frontend build:**
   - Look for "Frontend ready for deployment" message
   - Ensure no build errors in the logs

3. **Check file structure on Heroku:**
   ```bash
   heroku run ls -la frontend/
   heroku run ls -la frontend/dist/
   ```

### If build fails:

1. **Check frontend dependencies:**
   - Ensure all TypeScript deps are in `frontend/package.json`
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

2. **Local test:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ls -la dist/  # Should show built files
   ```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `.buildpacks` - Specifies buildpack order
- ✅ `package.json` - Added `heroku-postbuild` script
- ✅ `build-frontend.sh` - Build verification script
- ✅ `HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - This guide

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** using Option A above
2. **Monitor the build process** in the logs
3. **Test the application** once deployment completes
4. **Report back** if you encounter any issues

The fix addresses the core issue: ensuring Heroku builds the frontend during deployment so FastAPI can serve the React app correctly.
