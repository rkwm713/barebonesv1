=== WEBSOCKET AND REPORT VERSION FIXES ===
Date: 2025-01-23 00:43:00
Report Generator Version: 2.0.0

ISSUES ADDRESSED:
1. WebSocket connection rapidly opening/closing causing 404 errors
2. Reports appearing to be an older version

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

=== WebSocket Connection Fixes ===

File: frontend/src/hooks/useTaskStatus.ts
- Added cleanup flag (isCleanedUpRef) to prevent multiple cleanups
- Improved WebSocket error handling with proper fallback to polling
- Added 404 error detection to stop polling when tasks are deleted
- Implemented exponential backoff for polling errors (5 second retry)
- Added proper connection state tracking
- Enhanced logging for debugging WebSocket events
- Fixed TypeScript errors with null taskId handling

Key Changes:
- Cleanup function now prevents multiple executions
- WebSocket connections properly closed when tasks complete
- 404 responses trigger immediate cleanup (no more endless polling)
- Exponential backoff prevents rapid retry loops
- Better connection state management

=== Backend Download Improvements ===

File: backend/app.py
- Added cache-busting headers to file downloads:
  * Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
  * Pragma: no-cache
  * Expires: 0
- Added version headers:
  * X-Report-Version: 2.0.0
  * X-Generated-At: [timestamp]
- Added security headers:
  * X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  * X-Frame-Options: DENY

=== Report Generation Improvements ===

File: backend/barebones.py
- Added debug logging with timestamps in create_output_excel()
- Enhanced report generation tracking
- Ensured fresh Excel file generation every time

=== Expected Results ===

After these fixes:
1. WebSocket connections should no longer rapidly reconnect
2. No more 404 error spam in server logs
3. Proper cleanup when tasks complete or are deleted
4. Reports will have cache-busting headers ensuring fresh downloads
5. Version information included in download headers
6. Better error handling and connection management

=== Testing Recommendations ===

1. Upload a JSON file and monitor browser console for WebSocket logs
2. Check that connections properly close when processing completes
3. Verify downloaded reports have latest formatting and version headers
4. Confirm no 404 errors appear after task completion

=== Technical Details ===

WebSocket Flow:
1. Connect to ws://localhost:8000/ws/tasks/{task_id}
2. Receive status updates during processing
3. On completion/failure, cleanup() is called
4. Connection closes with code 1000 (normal closure)
5. No further polling attempts after cleanup

Download Headers:
- Reports now include generation timestamp
- Cache headers prevent browser caching of old versions
- Version headers allow tracking which code generated the report

=== Logging Added ===

Frontend console will now show:
- WebSocket connection events
- Task completion/cleanup events
- 404 detection and cleanup triggers

Backend logs will show:
- Report generation timestamps
- Excel file creation confirmation
- Processing completion status

These fixes should resolve both the WebSocket connection issues and ensure you always get the latest version of generated reports.
