# Changes Log - Heroku Deployment Setup

## Date: 5/22/2025

### Changes Made:

1. Added required Heroku configuration files:
   - `Procfile`: Defines process types and commands for running the application
   - `runtime.txt`: Specifies the Python version for Heroku

2. Updated `requirements.txt` to include:
   ```
   gunicorn==21.2.0
   ```

3. Modified `app.py` for Heroku compatibility:
   - Removed file system dependencies for uploads/outputs folders
   - Implemented in-memory file processing
   - Added PORT environment variable support for Heroku
   - Updated file download endpoint to serve files directly from memory
   - Simplified the cleanup process for memory-only storage

4. Updated `.gitignore` file with Heroku-specific exclusions and best practices.

5. Created `HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT.md` with detailed deployment instructions.

### Implementation Details:

1. **In-Memory File Processing**:
   - Modified the file upload process to store file content in memory
   - Created temporary files only during processing, then immediately cleaned up
   - Stored generated Excel and log files in BytesIO objects in the task dictionary
   - Updated download endpoint to serve files directly from memory using BytesIO

2. **Heroku Configuration**:
   - Created a Procfile with `web: gunicorn app:app` to tell Heroku how to run the app
   - Specified Python 3.11.9 in runtime.txt
   - Added port configuration to use Heroku's dynamic PORT environment variable

3. **Environment Handling**:
   - Updated app startup to check for PORT environment variable:
   ```python
   port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
   app.run(debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
   ```

### Benefits:

1. **Heroku Compatibility**: The application can now run on Heroku's ephemeral filesystem
2. **Scalability**: Ready for deployment on Heroku's dynos
3. **Memory-Only Processing**: No dependency on persistent storage
4. **Simple Deployment**: Clear documentation and configuration files for easy deployment
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Minimizes disk usage by keeping files in memory

### Testing:

The changes have been designed to:
- Maintain all existing functionality while working with Heroku's constraints
- Handle file processing entirely in memory when possible
- Clean up temporary files immediately after use
- Serve processed files directly from memory
- Use Heroku's environment variables for configuration

### Deployment:

Follow the instructions in HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT.md to deploy the application to Heroku.
