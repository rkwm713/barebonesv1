HEROKU DEPLOYMENT FIX - Report Generation Issue
===============================================
Date: 2025-05-23

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Web app was crashing on Heroku with "uvicorn: command not found"
- App was generating old reports because it wasn't actually running
- Two separate requirements.txt files:
  * Root: Flask dependencies (old app)
  * backend/: FastAPI dependencies (current app)
- Heroku only installs from root requirements.txt

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Merged both requirements files into root requirements.txt
- Added all FastAPI/uvicorn dependencies to root file
- Kept legacy Flask dependencies for compatibility

KEY CHANGES:
1. Updated root requirements.txt to include:
   - fastapi==0.115.0
   - uvicorn[standard]==0.30.1
   - python-multipart==0.0.9
   - websockets==13.1
   - aiofiles==24.1.0
   - pydantic==2.9.2
   - openpyxl==3.1.5

2. Organized dependencies by category:
   - FastAPI dependencies (current web app)
   - Data processing dependencies
   - Date utilities
   - Legacy Flask dependencies

NEXT STEPS:
1. Commit and push changes to git
2. Deploy to Heroku
3. Verify app starts successfully
4. Test file upload and report generation

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Heroku app should start without crashing
- uvicorn command will be found and executed
- Updated barebones.py code will be used for report generation
- No more old/cached reports

FILES MODIFIED:
- requirements.txt (merged dependencies)

FILES CREATED:
- HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.txt (this documentation)
