# Heroku Deployment Fix Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Root Route 404 Error
The root route (/) was returning a 404 error because the frontend static files were not being served correctly. This happened because:

- The Procfile was running the FastAPI app from the `/backend` directory: `cd backend && uvicorn app:app ...`
- The static file path calculation in `backend/app.py` uses a relative path based on the working directory:
  ```python
  static_files_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "frontend" / "dist"
  ```
- When running from the `/backend` directory, this path calculation couldn't find the frontend build directory.

### 2. Frontend Build Failure
The frontend build was failing on Heroku with the error: `sh: 1: tsc: not found`. This occurred because:

- Heroku sets `NODE_ENV=production`, so `npm ci` skips all devDependencies by default
- TypeScript is in devDependencies, so the TypeScript compiler wasn't available during build
- The `heroku-postbuild` script had an incorrect path for verifying the build output

### 3. Buildpack Order
The buildpack order (Python then Node) might lead to race conditions where the Python app starts before the frontend is fully built.

### 4. Runtime.txt Deprecation
The `runtime.txt` file is deprecated and generating warnings during deployment.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Procfile
Updated the Procfile to run the FastAPI app from the project root:
```
web: uvicorn backend.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

This ensures that the static file path calculation in `backend/app.py` works correctly, allowing the FastAPI app to serve the React frontend at the root URL.

### 2. Fixed Frontend Build Process
Updated the `heroku-postbuild` script to properly install devDependencies:
```json
"heroku-postbuild": "echo 'Starting Heroku build process...' && NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false npm --prefix frontend ci && echo 'Building frontend...' && npm --prefix frontend run build && echo 'Build complete. Verifying...' && ls -la frontend/dist/ && echo 'Frontend ready for deployment'"
```

This change:
- Sets `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false` to ensure devDependencies (including TypeScript) are installed
- Uses `npm --prefix frontend` to run commands in the frontend directory
- Ensures the correct path is used for verification

### 3. Maintained Correct Buildpack Order
Ensured buildpacks are in the correct order in `.buildpacks`:
```
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python
```

This ensures the Node.js buildpack runs first to build the frontend, and then the Python buildpack sets up the backend.

### 4. Replaced runtime.txt with .python-version
Created a `.python-version` file with:
```
3.11
```

This replaces the deprecated `runtime.txt` file and follows Heroku's recommended approach, which will:
- Silence the deprecation warning
- Automatically track the latest 3.11 patch version (currently 3.11.12)
- Ensure security updates are applied automatically

## Benefits
- The root route (/) will now correctly serve the React frontend
- The frontend build process completes successfully on Heroku with all dependencies
- The buildpack order ensures the frontend is built before the backend starts
- No more deprecation warnings during deployment
- Automatic security updates for Python
- No code changes were needed in the backend application logic

## Verification
After deploying these changes to Heroku, verify that:
1. The build completes successfully without any TypeScript errors
2. No deprecation warnings appear in the logs
3. The root URL no longer returns a 404 error
4. The frontend is correctly displayed when visiting the root URL
5. API endpoints at `/api/*` continue to work as expected
6. The automatic documentation at `/docs` is still accessible

## Additional Notes
- These fixes follow Heroku best practices for fullstack applications
- The app structure remains clean with backend code in the `/backend` directory and frontend code in the `/frontend` directory
