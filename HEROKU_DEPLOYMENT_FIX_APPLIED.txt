# Heroku Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
The root route (/) was returning a 404 error because the frontend static files were not being served correctly. This happened because:

1. The Procfile was running the FastAPI app from the `/backend` directory: `cd backend && uvicorn app:app ...`
2. The static file path calculation in `backend/app.py` uses a relative path based on the working directory:
   ```python
   static_files_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "frontend" / "dist"
   ```
3. When running from the `/backend` directory, this path calculation couldn't find the frontend build directory.

## Solution Implemented
The Procfile was updated to run the FastAPI app from the project root:
```
web: uvicorn backend.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

This ensures that the static file path calculation in `backend/app.py` works correctly, allowing the FastAPI app to serve the React frontend at the root URL.

## Benefits
- The root route (/) will now correctly serve the React frontend
- No code changes were needed in the backend
- Path calculations remain consistent with the project structure
- The frontend build process remains unchanged

## Verification
After deploying this change to Heroku, verify that:
1. The root URL no longer returns a 404 error
2. The frontend is correctly displayed when visiting the root URL
3. API endpoints at `/api/*` continue to work as expected
4. The automatic documentation at `/docs` is still accessible

## Additional Notes
- This fix preserves the existing Node.js buildpack and `heroku-postbuild` script that builds the frontend
- No changes to the frontend code or build process were necessary
- The app structure remains clean with backend code in the `/backend` directory and frontend code in the `/frontend` directory
