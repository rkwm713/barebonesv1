# Heroku Deployment Fix Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Root Route 404 Error
The root route (/) was returning a 404 error because the frontend static files were not being served correctly. This happened because:

- The Procfile was running the FastAPI app from the `/backend` directory: `cd backend && uvicorn app:app ...`
- The static file path calculation in `backend/app.py` uses a relative path based on the working directory:
  ```python
  static_files_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "frontend" / "dist"
  ```
- When running from the `/backend` directory, this path calculation couldn't find the frontend build directory.

### 2. Frontend Build Failure
The frontend build was failing on Heroku with the error: `sh: 1: tsc: not found`. This occurred because:

- The build script in `frontend/package.json` was using the `tsc` command directly, which wasn't available in the Heroku environment
- The `heroku-postbuild` script had an incorrect path for verifying the build output

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Procfile
Updated the Procfile to run the FastAPI app from the project root:
```
web: uvicorn backend.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

This ensures that the static file path calculation in `backend/app.py` works correctly, allowing the FastAPI app to serve the React frontend at the root URL.

### 2. Fixed Frontend Build Process
1. Modified the frontend build script to use the local TypeScript installation:
   ```json
   "build": "npx tsc && vite build"
   ```

2. Fixed the path in the `heroku-postbuild` script for verifying the build output:
   ```json
   "heroku-postbuild": "... && ls -la dist/ && ..."
   ```
   (Changed from `ls -la frontend/dist/`)

## Benefits
- The root route (/) will now correctly serve the React frontend
- The frontend build process completes successfully on Heroku
- Path calculations remain consistent with the project structure
- No code changes were needed in the backend application logic

## Verification
After deploying these changes to Heroku, verify that:
1. The build completes successfully without any TypeScript errors
2. The root URL no longer returns a 404 error
3. The frontend is correctly displayed when visiting the root URL
4. API endpoints at `/api/*` continue to work as expected
5. The automatic documentation at `/docs` is still accessible

## Additional Notes
- These fixes preserve the existing Node.js and Python buildpacks
- The app structure remains clean with backend code in the `/backend` directory and frontend code in the `/frontend` directory
