# Reference Direction Update

## Summary
Implemented proper cardinal direction calculation for reference connections in column 9 of the output Excel file. Previously, references were showing as "Ref()" without a direction. Now they will display as "Ref(NW)" with the correct cardinal direction based on the bearing between the pole and reference node.

## Changes Made
1. Added improved bearing calculation functions:
   - `bearing_degrees`: Calculates the true bearing (0-360Â°) between two coordinate points
   - `to_cardinal`: Converts a bearing to a cardinal direction (16-point compass rose by default)
   - `cardinal_between_nodes`: Helper function that calculates the cardinal direction between a pole and reference node

2. Updated reference connection identification:
   - Now properly identifies reference connections by checking both `button = "ref"` and `attributes.connection_type = "reference"`

3. Fixed coordinate retrieval:
   - Now gets pole coordinates directly from the pole node (with fallback to first section point)
   - Gets reference node coordinates from the reference node itself

4. Improved label formatting:
   - Now displays "Ref (NW) to Reference" with the correct cardinal direction 
   - Includes the reference node type in the label (e.g., "Anchor", "Reference")

## Benefits
- Provides clearer spatial context in the Excel output by showing the cardinal direction of reference nodes
- Properly follows the connection information from the Katapult JSON data structure
- Uses a standard 16-point compass rose for more precise direction information

## Technical Details
The implementation uses the Haversine formula to calculate the true bearing between two coordinate points, then maps the bearing to cardinal directions using a 16-point compass rose (N, NNE, NE, ENE, etc.).

If the pole lacks coordinates, it falls back to using the first section point of the connection. If no valid coordinates can be found, it displays "??" as the direction.
