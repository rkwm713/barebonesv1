# Heroku Deployment Setup - Summary

## Overview

The MakeReady Report Generator has been configured for deployment to Heroku. This document summarizes the changes made to make the application ready for Heroku deployment.

## Files Created

1. **Heroku Configuration Files**
   - `Procfile`: Tells Heroku to run the app using gunicorn
   - `runtime.txt`: Specifies Python 3.11.9 as the runtime

2. **Documentation**
   - `HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT.md`: Step-by-step deployment instructions
   - `HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT_CHANGES.txt`: Detailed technical changes log
   - `README_HEROKU.md`: Overview of the web application

## Files Modified

1. **app.py**
   - Updated to use in-memory file processing
   - Added temporary directory handling
   - Added PORT environment variable support
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Modified file handling to work with Heroku's ephemeral filesystem
   - Updated file downloading to serve from memory

2. **requirements.txt**
   - Added gunicorn for production web server

3. **.gitignore**
   - Updated for Heroku deployment
   - Added patterns for temporary files

## Key Changes

### In-Memory Processing

The application now processes files in memory rather than on disk:
- Files are uploaded and stored in memory
- Temporary files are created only when needed for processing and immediately cleaned up
- Processed Excel and log files are stored in memory using BytesIO objects
- Files are served directly from memory when downloaded

### Environment Configuration

- Added support for Heroku's dynamic PORT environment variable
- Disabled debug mode in production
- Created a dedicated temp directory for temporary files

### Health Monitoring

- Added a `/health` endpoint for monitoring application status

## Next Steps

1. Follow the instructions in `HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT.md` to deploy the application
2. Test the deployed application
3. Monitor the logs using `heroku logs --tail`

## Future Improvements

For a more robust production deployment, consider:
1. Adding authentication
2. Setting up cloud storage (S3) for file persistence
3. Implementing a proper job queue (Celery/RQ)
4. Adding task expiration to prevent memory leaks
5. Setting up monitoring and alerts
