ATTACHER PROCESSING UPDATE - May 22, 2025
=========================================

ISSUE ADDRESSED:
Missing attachers (like street_light, drip_loop) that ARE below neutral height

ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:
1. Missing _measured_height in photofirst_data for items
2. Missing or incomplete trace information
3. Function only processing 'wire' category, missing 'equipment' and 'guying'

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Enhanced get_attachers_for_node() to process all three categories:
   - wire
   - equipment  
   - guying

2. Added comprehensive error handling and logging:
   - Tracks items with missing _measured_height
   - Tracks items with missing trace information
   - Logs skip reasons for analysis

3. Improved neutral height filtering:
   - Only applies filter when neutral height is available
   - Warns when neutral wire not found
   - Special handling for down guys below neutral

4. Created ProcessingLogger class for detailed tracking:
   - Node statistics (with/without neutral)
   - Item statistics by category
   - Skip reason breakdown
   - Detailed node-by-node logs

RESULTS:
- Successfully processes equipment items (street lights, etc.)
- Captures guying items (down guys) below neutral
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
- 60.6% processing success rate in test run

FILES UPDATED:
- barebones.py - Main processing script with enhanced attacher detection
- CPS_6457E_03_Processing_Log.txt - Sample output showing detailed processing stats
